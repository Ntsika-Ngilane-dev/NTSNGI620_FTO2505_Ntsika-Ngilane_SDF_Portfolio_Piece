Portfolio App — Code explanation (section by section)

This file explains the structure and purpose of each source file in the `portfolio-app` folder.

1) `index.html`
- The HTML entry served by Vite. It contains an empty `<div id="root"></div>` where React mounts.
- Loads the client bundle via `<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>`.

2) `package.json`
- Project metadata and scripts.
- `scripts.dev` runs `vite`.
- `dependencies` include `react`, `react-dom`, and `lucide-react` for icons.
- `devDependencies` include `vite`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer` and `@vitejs/plugin-react`.

3) `vite.config.js`
- Vite configuration file. Imports `@vitejs/plugin-react` and registers it so Vite correctly transforms JSX/React code.
- Configures the dev server port (default 5173) — you can modify options here later (host, proxy, etc.).

4) `postcss.config.cjs` and `tailwind.config.cjs`
- `postcss.config.cjs` registers the `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` PostCSS plugins used during build.
- `tailwind.config.cjs` lists the files Tailwind should scan for utility class usage (index.html and `src/**/*`). Extend the theme or add plugins here if desired.

5) `src/index.css`
- Tailwind entry that imports `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components` and `@tailwind utilities`.
- Contains small global tweaks (height and font-family). This file is imported by `src/main.jsx` so styles are bundled by Vite.

6) `src/main.jsx`
- Application bootstrap.
- Imports React, `createRoot` from `react-dom/client`, `src/index.css` and the `Portfolio` component.
- Renders `<Portfolio />` into `#root` using React 18's `createRoot` API.

7) `src/Portfolio.jsx`
- The main UI component. It contains the single-page layout and maps to the design you provided. The component sections are:
  - Header: rounded card with a circular avatar (`/avatar.jpg`), name, and short summary paragraph.
  - Proficiency: left column showing progress bars for Mobile, Web, Backend, DB, IoT, AI, Security. These are implemented with styled `<div>` elements (Tailwind classes) and inline `style.width` values.
  - Skills: right column shows many skills as small pill-like buttons arranged in a 3-column grid.
  - Projects: a 4-column grid with project cards. One card uses a green background and shows an "IN PROGRESS" badge; others are neutral.
  - Experience & Achievements: larger section (spanning 2 columns) with multiple achievement cards and status badges.
  - Tools: small grid of square tiles showing tool names with color backgrounds.
  - Professional Interests: stacked cards highlighting areas of interest.
  - Footer / CTA: gradient orange call-to-action with contact details and icons provided by `lucide-react` (`Mail`, `Phone`, `MapPin`).

Important implementation notes:
- The component uses Tailwind utility classes for spacing, color, responsiveness and hover effects. There is no routing — this is a single page component.
- Avatar image is referenced as `/avatar.jpg` (served from the `public/` folder at the project root). Replace that file to change the image.

8) `public/avatar.jpg`
- Static asset (copied from your images folder) placed in the `public/` folder so the app can reference it by `/avatar.jpg`.

9) `.gitignore`
- Standard ignore rules for `node_modules`, `dist`, `.env` files and IDE settings.

10) `README.md`
- Contains setup instructions, quick-start, build commands, and notes about the scaffold. It also lists recent actions (avatar copy, dependencies installed, dev server started) and includes the repository link.

Running & troubleshooting
- Start dev server: `npm install` then `npm run dev`. Open `http://localhost:5173`.
- If Tailwind classes do not apply, confirm `src/index.css` is imported in `src/main.jsx` and that Vite builds successfully.
- If icons from `lucide-react` fail to render, ensure `lucide-react` is installed and the component import paths are correct.

Extending the project
- Convert to TypeScript: rename files to `.tsx` and add `typescript` + tsconfig.
- Add ESLint/Prettier: add `eslint` config and `prettier` rules and a `lint` script.
- Add CI: a simple GitHub Actions workflow can run `npm ci` and `npm run build` on pushes/PRs.

If you'd like, I can produce a PR with these changes on a new branch and push it to the remote repository.
